/**
 * Everything the project has learned to read, and a way to take one entry back.
 *
 * Learning is self-correcting only while the tile keeps appearing: `mergeGlyphs` replaces on
 * identical bits, so a mistyped character is fixed by reading the box again. A tile wrongly ticked
 * *Not text* is not — it matches from then on, contributes nothing to `unknown`, and the learner
 * never asks about it a second time. Forgetting the entry is what puts such a tile back in front
 * of the learner, which is why this panel exists at all.
 *
 * No confirmation on the button. A removal is one undo step — `coalesceKeyFor` deliberately does
 * not coalesce `glyph/forgotten` — so the app already holds the answer to a misclick, and a prompt
 * per glyph would make correcting a handful of them a chore.
 *
 * Escape is handled by `useAlertDialogFocus`, on `document` in the capture phase: `DialoguePanel`
 * binds its own Escape-to-close on `window`, and one key press must not both close this and the
 * panel it was opened from.
